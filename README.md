<div>This project shows photos taken by NASA's Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit rovers on Mars.

Each Rover has its own gallery of photos that can be filtered by Earth Date, Sol Date, and Camera.

### ROVER Details


<br>

<p>
Photos are organized by the sol (Martian rotation or day) on which they were taken, counting up from the rover's landing date. A photo taken on Curiosity's 1000th Martian sol exploring Mars, for example, will have a sol attribute of 1000. If instead you prefer to search by the Earth date on which a photo was taken, you can do that, too. <br>
